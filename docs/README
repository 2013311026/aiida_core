AIDA (Ab Initio DAtabase)

Nov 18, 2011
--------------------------------------------------
This is the django implementation of AIDA.

Here is a quick description of the start of the AIDA project layout.

The directory tree (for now) is roughly as follows:

aida/       -- top-level dir
 aidadb/    -- django directory containing settings.py, manage.py, and
               ORM models, urls and views
 docs/      -- documentation directory
 SQL/       -- contains initial db creation scripts, a backup and
               restore script, and will eventually contain stored
               procedures if needed
 templates/ -- contains html, css, js, img elements for rendering the
               AIDA site

The MySQL database is called aidadb. See the creation script for this
in SQL/scripts/create_aida_db.sql. aidadj was an earlier database for
django specific tables, that is no longer being created. As the root
MySQL user, source this sql file from within MySQL.

To restore the version of the aidab with all tables as currently
available in my developemnt tree, cd to SQL directory, and run:

$ python restore.py

It will ask for confirmation, and ask you to enter the aida_user
password for aidadb.

Now from the aidadb directory, you can run the development server:

$ python manage.py runserver

and then you can browse to the following urls on your web browser:

http://localhost:8000/aida/
http://localhost:8000/aida/admin/

This is the just the start of the implementation of the full GUI. More
to be added soon.
