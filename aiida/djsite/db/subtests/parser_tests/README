Place here a folder for each test that you want to run.
Folder names should start with "test_" and contain only digits, letters and underscores, otherwise the folder will be ignored.
Please follow the convention "test_plugin_name_details" where plugin_name is the name of the plugin, where dots and other simbols are converted with underscores.

You can create a valid folder using
from aiida.djsite.db.subtests.parsers import output_test
output_test(PK, FOLDER)
where PK is the PK of the calculation that you want to export, and FOLDER is the output folder. FOLDER name must match the following regular expression: test_[a-zA-Z0-9_]*
You can then edit the folder removing the input nodes that are not needed. Remove both the folder and the corresonding entry from the _aiida_linkdata.json json file!

The above is sufficient to just check if the parser does not fail on the given calculation.

If you also want to check values:
create a 
_aiida_checks.json
JSON file inside the folder.
* Each key represents an output node that should be present.
* Each value is a dictionary with multiple keys (an empty dictionary will just check for the existence of the output node).
* Each key of the subdictionary is an attribute to check for. The value is a dictionary that should at least have two keys: "comparison", a string to say the type of comparison, and "value", with the value to compare with. An example::
  {
    "output_parameters": {
      "energy": {
        "comparison": "AlmostEqual",
        "value": -3699.26590536037
      },
      "energy_units": {
        "comparison": "Equal",
        "value": "eV"
      }
    }, 
    "output_array": {
    }
  }

Note that the list of valid comparisons is hardcoded inside the aiida.djsite.db.subtests.parsers module; if you need new comparison types, just add them to the module.
